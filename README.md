# ThrottleBlaster

A Pi Pico-based solution that reduces the effective frequency of fast CPUs by pulling down the STPCLK# pin at a specified frequency and duty-cycle.

This allows you to play speed-sensitive games, like Digger on a 1200MHz Athlon!

# How it works
The Throttle Blaster is a fancy PWM controller that pulls the CPU's STPCLK# to ground.

<img src='img/diagram.png' height=200 width=auto>

It is tailored to the needs of vintage PC enthusiasts, so it drives a 4-digit 7-segment display and is pre-loaded with presets that span several hardware generations.


# Features
- Four modes of operation to fit your needs, selected by jumpers:
  1. single push-button control. This is great for re-purposing the Turbo button (NOTE: the on/off turbo switch would need to be replaced with a push-button).
  2. Two-button control (left/right).
  3. rotary-encoder with a push-button. This is great for placing it on a drive bay panel.
  4. analogue potentiometer with/without a push-button. This could be used for configurations without a display.
- 7-segment TM1637-based display that shows the effective frequency. This can be considered optional, but is highly recommended.
- Cycle through preset frequencies or select a frequency at a 1MHz granularity.
- Each preset can be tuned/programmed both in terms of the PWM level but also the PWM frequency.
- Configuration changes are permanently stored in the Pico's flash memory.
- The PWM pulses are generated by the Pico's PIOs and are clock-accurate, with no jitter.


# Mode 1: Rotary Encoder (ROT)

- The devices starts at the "Presets" state (mode).
- Turn the knob to select a frequency
- Short push to switch to fine-grain frequency selection

<img src='img/rotary_states.png' height=240 width=auto>

## Initial configuration
- The default CPU frequency is 200MHz. Long push to configure the CPU speed. Select the frequency and short push to get back to the presets.

# Mode 2: Single-button (1Btn)

- The device starts at the "Presets" state.
- Three types of push:
  1. Short push (release immediately)
  2. Medium push (for ~0.5 seconds)
  3. Long push (about 2 seconds)
- Cycle through presets with a short push. A medium push brings us back to the default CPU frequency.
- Long push to enter programming mode.

# Mode 3: Two-button (2Btn)

- The device starts at the "Presets" state.
- Two types of push: long and short
- Three types of actions:
  1. Short Left or Right push (release immediately)
  2. Both Left and Right short push
  3. Both Left and Right long push.
- Cycle through presets with a L or R short push.
- Go to 1-1 manual mode with both L and R short push.
- Long push (L or R) to enter programming mode, or to configure the CPU Frequency (CPUF) when showing the maximum frequency.
- Reset to defaults by long press L and R twice.

# Mode 4: Potentiometer (POT)

- Can be used in conjunction with the single-button operation. Turning the potentiometer overrides the preset selected by the button.

# Serial Mode (UART): Control by the serial port, works in conjunction with all other modes.

You can connect to the Throttle Blaster via the serial port and set the Frequency and PWM Period.
This is convenient for launching a game with a `.bat` file that first configures the Throttle Blaster and then launches the game.


## Reverse Direction jumper JP3 (since rev 0.4)
Since revision 0.4 the default rotation direction of the knob has been changed and a new jumper JP3 has been added.
Closing the jumper will reverse the direction for both the rotary encoder and the potentiometer.

## Circuit
- Connect the Throttle Blaster's Tx pin to the PC's serial port Rx pin (that is pin 2 of the serial connector), the Throttle Blaster's Rx pin to serial Tx (pin 3) and ground to ground (pin 5)


## Software
- Serial port settings: 9600 8N1, no flow control
- The string to send is in the form `F<MHz>P<Period>\r`, where:
  - `<MHz>` is the desired effective frequency in MHz (float),
  - `<Period>` is the PWM Period level (1-256),
  - `\r` (also seen as `^M`) is the Carriage-Return character (ASCII 13 0x0d).
  - For example `F4.77P8` sets the frequency to `4.77MHz` and the PWM period to `8` which is a around 50us.
- In DOS you can use a terminal emulator, like [Kermit](http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ftp/archives/msk314.zip), to connect and send the command.
  - You could use this one-liner in a batch file: `kermit set port COM1, set speed 9600, output F4.77P8\13`. This will set the frequency to 4.77 MHz, the period to 8 and will send a Carriage-Return character (`\13`).

> **Note**
> Changing the frequency is not instantaneous. So if you are setting the frequency in a batch file, please consider adding a delay before launching the game.

> **Note**
> Please note that the serial-port functionality is totally optional. You don't need to populate the MAX3232 IC and its capacitors if you are not planning to use it.

The Pico should boot and you should see the Pico's LED light up.

# Circuit

## Schematic

<img src='img/ThrottleBlaster.svg' alt="Throttle Blaster Schematic" height=300 width=auto>

The Throttle Blaster circuit is fairly simple:
- The Rotary Encoder, the Push Button and the Potentiometer are connected to the Pico's GPIOs.
- The Display is also connected directly to GPIOs
- The STPCLK# pin is driven by a N-channel MOSFET, a 2N7000, and its gate pin connects to the Pico's GPIO via a 1K resistor and the transistor's drain connects to STPCLK# via a 100 Ohm resistor.
- The circuit is powered directly from the PSU's 5V power supply via diode (preferrably a Schottky).
- The serial port circuit relies on a MAX3232 for converting the RS232 levels to Pi-Pico levels.

## Using the circuit for the first time
- Select the operation mode using jumpers JP1/JP2.
- Connect J1 to your CPU's STPCLK# pin.
- Power it on and you are good to go.
- You can reverse the knob direction by closing JP3 (since rev.0.4)


## How to find the `STPCLK#` pin
Just look for it in your CPU's datasheet. 
This table lists the STPCLK# pin number for your reference:
